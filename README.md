# .Net6
The main task is to optimize, improve and cover unit tests of this code using design patterns and libraries

## Use Enity Framework
1. Understand the implementation of Entity Framework. Understand why it is better to use.
2. What are the problems with the existing performance? 
3. What do you think needs to be improved?
4. How should test coverage be developed?

### Develop logging subsystem.
1. Choose the logging system that you think will be optimal for use.
2. Think over the expansion logging system
3. Think over unit tests coverage

### Expanding the capabilities of the controller
1. Add a new add & update method
2. Add a new get method with parameters
3. Don't forget to use for response return and error handling schemes. 
4. What response types and how can use in this project?
5. How do you make this clear to Swagger?


### Unit tests
1. Create external project for unit tests
2. The percentage of test coverage of your code should exceed 70 percent.

It is strongly requested use SOLID Design Principles during development. Before starting work, find and describe the SOLID issues in implementation and describe how you plan to fix them.
